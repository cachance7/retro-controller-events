#Event Emitter for Tomee Retro USB SNES Controller

## Description
This executable reads a binary message stream (file or *stdin*) for the controller input events and emits human readable event messages to *stdout*.

On the RaspberryPi B+ model, a suitable message source would be `/dev/input/by-path/platform-bcm2708_usb-usb-0\:1.2.3\:1.0-event-joystick`.

## Build & Run
1. Clone the repo
2. `make`
3. `joystick_events <message_source_path>`
